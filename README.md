# The Weather Map App

https://ntparker.github.io/Weather-Map-App/

For this project, our group decided to create an all in one weather/map application that would allow the user to view the weather and a map of a city of their choosing, while still being able to view the weather in their current location. This was acheived using JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and three server side APIs. We utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain the weather information for multiple cities, the MapTiles API to generate an ineractive map of the searched city, and a database of over 40,000 cities to provide the user with an intuitive, easy to use weather application.
